# NAEI Multi-Group Line Chart Viewer v2.4

Version 2.4 of the line chart viewer now uses **shared resources** for better code maintainability and consistency across NAEI viewer applications.

## What's New in v2.4

### Shared Resources Integration
- **Supabase Configuration**: Uses `../../Shared Resources/supabase-config.js` for database connection
- **Analytics Module**: Uses `../../Shared Resources/analytics.js` for lightweight page-view + interaction tracking
- **Color Palette**: Uses `../../Shared Resources/colors.js` for consistent color assignment
- **Common Styles**: Uses `../../Shared Resources/common-styles.css` for base styling
- **Shared Images**: Logo, favicon, and social media icons from shared directory

### Benefits
- **Consistency**: All NAEI viewers use the same color scheme and branding
- **Maintainability**: Update shared code once, affects all viewers
- **Reduced Duplication**: No duplicate code for analytics, colors, or styling
- **Easy Updates**: Change database credentials or analytics logic in one place

4. Check browser console for errors

## Backwards Compatibility

v2.3 remains unchanged and continues to work independently. v2.4 is a parallel version that demonstrates the shared resources architecture.
